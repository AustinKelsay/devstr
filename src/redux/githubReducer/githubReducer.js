// repos = []
// Put the repos in the redux store and add a broadcasted bool to each repo defaulting to false
// if a repo gets broadcasted, check if it's in the store
// if it's in the store, then flip the broadcasted bool to true
// if it's not in the store, then add it to the store with the broadcasted bool set to true
